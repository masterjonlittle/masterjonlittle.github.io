                During my time at Summer Discovery we learned how to do many diffrent things. 
                One of those this are Unity Devolpment. Unity is something that you use to help devolp animations or games. 
                We learned how to create games,objects moving objects. It was so fun learning how to create games even tho it was tedious. 
                Overall this new experience was fun and i hope to do more in the future.

                   Doing web Development was cool because the finish product was worth it but doing the actual coding was pretty tedious and very fusturating I though my hands were going to fall of because of that. Overall the experience of learning  of how to code was cool and I hope I can do more in the future
